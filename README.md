# SecureWebApiCookiesExample
ASP.NET Core Web Api and Angular application exemplifying how you can secure a web api using cookies

You can run the ASP.NET Core application using the command line executing `dotnet run`.

You can run the Angular client (assuming you have all the required dependencies installed) by doing: `ng serve --open`.

This project is described in detail in two blog posts: [Secure an ASP.NET Core Web Api using Cookies](https://www.blinkingcaret.com/2018/07/18/secure-an-asp-net-core-web-api-using-cookies/) and [ASP.NET Core Web Api Antiforgery](https://www.blinkingcaret.com/2018/11/29/asp-net-core-web-api-antiforgery/).
